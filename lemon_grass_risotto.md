# Lemon Grass Risotto

A delicious blend of creamisess with the aromatic lemnon grass make this the perfect risotto for an Italian-Thai fusion style meal.
 
## Ingredients
- 4 cups (~1000ml) vegetable stock (later I'll place a recipe for that) 
- 2 cups arborio rice
- 400ml coconut milk
- 2 stalks of fresh lemongrass
- 3 medium sized cloves garlic
- 1 cup dry white wine
- 1 small red onion
- fresh thyme leaves for garnish (optional)
- olive oil
- salt & pepper to taste

## Method

### The day before

We will prepare our risotto moistening ingredient first. It requires a good 12h of headstart to ensure that you are extracting as much flavor as you can.

1. start off by coarsely cutting you lemmon grass and then "crack" it by slamming it with a blunt object(like the back of your knife)
2. finely chop 2 of the garlic cloves
3. in a deep saucepan, add 300ml of the coconut milk, and the 1 litre of vegetable stock (you could sub it for a chicken or meat stock if you please) and bring to a gentle boil
4. in a skillet, add 2 tbl spoons of olive oil over medium heat, and add the garlic and lemon grass.
5. when the garlic starts looking like it could brown, pour the remaining 100ml of coconut milk in the skillet. Stir well to make sure you are getting all the flavours from the pan.
6. after a minute or so, transfer the contents of the skillet to the simmering mixture of stock and coconut milk (with stalks and all).
7. season to taste with salt and some pepper (the lemon grass flavor will be mild at this point of time).
8. after it comes back up to a boil, give it a couple more minutes, then turn off the heat and reserve it. 
9. when it cools off, pop it in the fridge for at least 12 hours.

### The day of the meal

We are now pretty much all set to go about our risotto. Get ready for a good 

1. reheat the stock mixture from yesterday
2. when it is hot (you don't need to bring it to a boil), strain it through a sieve into a saucepan.
3. while that drips merrily, finely chop your red onion and garlic.
4. put that back on the stove and keep it at a gentle simmer
5. in a pan big enough for your risotto, heat up some olive oil (about 2 tbl spoons) over medium heat
6. add the onions and sautÃ©e them for a minute
7. add the garlic and give that another minute
8. up the heat and add in the risotto rice and stir well to make sure it is all coated with the now flavored olive oil

> From now on - you'll only stop stirring when the risotto is done, so get ready for a good 15 - 20 minutes of oven time.

9. toast the rice for a couple of minutes - stir constantly to avoid burning
10. add in all of the white wine - still stirring
11. once it comes back to a boil, lower your heat to a medium / medium low intensity
12. keep stirring an when it starts to dry up, add a ladle or two of your boiling stock mixture to keep it wet

> (you want to add enough liquid to cover the rice)

13. after about 10-12 minutes, your risotto should be nearing completion, take a grain or two of rice, bite into it, it should still be crunchy in the center. 
14. correct any salt you might need now
15. Every minute or so, take a couple of grains and bite into them, the minute they loose the crunch, they are ready.


Serve immediately.
